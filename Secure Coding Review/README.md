# CodeAlpha Task 3: Secure Coding Review

## Objective
The objective of this task is to review a programming language and application for security vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for secure coding practices using tools like static code analyzers and manual code review.

## Programming Language and Application
For this task, we have chosen Python and a simple Flask web application. The application consists of a basic web server with endpoints to demonstrate potential security vulnerabilities.

## Recommendations for Secure Coding Practices Using SQL
1. **Sanitize User Inputs to Prevent XSS:**
   - Always sanitize and validate user inputs before using them in SQL queries or returning them to the client.
   - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
   - Example: Use the `escape` function from the `markupsafe` library to sanitize user inputs before inserting them into the database.

    ```python
    from markupsafe import escape

    @app.route('/data', methods=['POST'])
    def data():
        user_data = escape(request.form['data'])
        insert_data(user_data)
        return f'You sent: {user_data}'

    def insert_data(data):
        conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute('INSERT INTO data (info) VALUES (?)', (data,))
        conn.commit()
        conn.close()
    ```

2. **Implement CSRF Protection:**
   - Use secure tokens to protect against CSRF attacks.
   - Ensure that every form submission includes a unique CSRF token.
   - Example: Use Flask's built-in CSRF protection by installing and configuring the `Flask-WTF` extension.

    ```python
    from flask_wtf.csrf import CSRFProtect

    app = Flask(__name__)
    csrf = CSRFProtect(app)
    ```

3. **Disable Debug Mode in Production:**
   - Ensure that the `debug` mode is disabled in production.

    ```python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=False)
    ```

## Static Code Analysis Tools
To enhance security, use the following static code analysis tools:
1. **Bandit:** A security linter for Python. Install using `pip install bandit` and run with `bandit -r your_script.py`.
2. **PyLint:** A general-purpose static code analyzer. Install using `pip install pylint` and run with `pylint your_script.py`.
3. **SonarQube:** A comprehensive static code analysis tool. Set it up with a SonarQube server and analyze your code through its interface.
