# TASK 1 - Basic Network Sniffer
Build a network sniffer in Python that captures and analyzes network traffic.<br>
This project will help you understand how data flows on a network and how network packets are structured.

Python Code to View the Packets in a network.<br>
- Package Used: [**Scapy**](https://scapy.net/)<br>
    - Cheat Sheet: [https://wiki.sans.blue/Tools/pdfs/ScapyCheatSheet_v0.2.pdf](https://wiki.sans.blue/Tools/pdfs/ScapyCheatSheet_v0.2.pdf)

## Setting Up the Sniffer

## Scanning - using Nmap
Through Scanning using Nmap we send packets to destinated IP, and we can sniff those packets for demo.

## Conclusion

By utilizing **Python** and the **Scapy** we can create a fundamental packet sniffer. This tool enables us to examine essential packet details such as source and destination addresses, port information, and other packet-specific data.
